# Computer Networking - A top down approach

## Computer networks and the internet

- a route or a path
- ISP
- RFC
- protocols
- primary types of hosts
- access networks
- two primary types of physical media
- packets
- packet switches
- two major types of packet switches
- store and forward transmission method
- the forwarding table
- circuit switching
- multiplexing in circuit switching
- access, regional and tier 1 ISPs
- point of presence (POP)
- multi homing
- peered ISPs
- internet exchange point (IXP)
- content provider networks
- networks structures
- protocol layering
- service model
- the application layer
- the transport layer
- the network layer
- the link layer
- data frame encapsulation
- payload vs header in data frames
- DOS attacks
- three primary types of DOS attacks
- DDOS attacks
- packet sniffing
- IP spoofing

## Application layer

- the level at which applications operate
- client server architecture and datacenters
- P2P architecture
- the shared definition of server and client in the network application architectures
- sockets
- proccess addressing
- socket vs port
- dimensions of transport layer protocols
- TCP provided services
- TLS
- things defined by an application layer protocol
- HTTP being an stateless protocol
- persistent and non-persistent connections
- HTTP request structure
- HTTP response structure
